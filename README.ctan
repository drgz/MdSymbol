MdSymbol - A math symbol font
=============================

MdSymbol is a math symbol font, designed as a companion to Myriad Pro
by Adobe, but it might also fit other contemporary typefaces. MdSymbol
is based on FdSymbol by Michael Ummels released under the SIL Open
Font License, Version 1.1.

The development of this font package is hosted at github:
http://github.com/sebschub/MdSymbol

Usage
-----

To use this font in LaTeX, include

    \usepackage{MdSymbol}

in the preamble of your LaTeX document. See the PDF documentation for
the details.

Installation
------------

1. Run `latex MdSymbol.ins` to generate the LaTeX package.

2. Create the following directories in a local texmf tree:

   - doc/latex/MdSymbol
   - fonts/map/dvips/MdSymbol
   - fonts/enc/dvips/MdSymbol
   - fonts/tfm/public/MdSymbol
   - fonts/type1/public/MdSymbol
   - tex/latex/MdSymbol

3. Copy all necessary files into the texmf tree:

   - MdSymbol.pdf goes to doc/latex/MdSymbol
   - MdSymbol.map in the dvips directory goes to fonts/map/dvips/MdSymbol
   - all other files in the dvips directory go to fonts/enc/dvips/MdSymbol
   - all files in the tfm directory go to fonts/tfm/public/MdSymbol
   - all files in the type1 directory go to fonts/type1/public/MdSymbol
   - MdSymbol.sty goes to tex/latex/MdSymbol

4. Afterwards, you may need to regenerate the file database:

    texhash

5. Finally, you need to activate the map file:

    updmap --enable Map=MdSymbol.map

For a system-wide installation, replace updmap by updmap-sys.
